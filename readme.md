# Genetic and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
This repo contains two projects. the genetic directory contains Matlab codes that aim to optimize some evaluation functions:
1. Ackley
2. griewank
3. rastrigin
4. rotate-hyper ellipsoid
5. schwef
6. sphere
7. styblinski

the genetic_pso contains some comparison between two algorithms. also pso algorithm implemented in Matlab is presented.

The graph directories contains graph in .fig format which Matlabs native format for saving figures.

Hope it helps you :)
