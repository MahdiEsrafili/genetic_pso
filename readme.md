# Genetic and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
This repo contains two projects. the genetic directory contains Matlab codes that aim to optimize some evaluation functions:
1. Ackley
2. griewank
3. rastrigin
4. rotate-hyper ellipsoid
5. schwef
6. sphere
7. styblinski

the genetic_pso contains some comparison between two algorithms. also pso algorithm implemented in Matlab is presented.

Hope it helps you :)
